<h1>Code Explanation</h1>

<p>Below is a line-by-line explanation of the code:</p>

<code>#include "DigiKeyboard.h"</code>
<p>This line includes the header file "DigiKeyboard.h," which contains the necessary definitions and functions for interacting with the DigiKeyboard.</p>

<code>void setup()</code>
<p>This marks the beginning of the <code>setup()</code> function, which is called once when the Arduino board is powered on or reset.</p>

<code>  DigiKeyboard.delay(1000);</code>
<p>This line causes a delay of 1000 milliseconds (1 second) in the execution of the program.</p>

<!-- Add explanations for other lines of code -->

<code>void loop()</code>
<p>This is the <code>loop()</code> function, which runs repeatedly after the <code>setup()</code> function.</p>

<p>That's a brief explanation of the provided code.</p>
